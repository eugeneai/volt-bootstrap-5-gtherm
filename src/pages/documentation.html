                            which allows one to calculate the heat flow and lithospheric mantle thickness. 
                            The software also provides a range of visualization options, 
                            generating custom graphs capable to be an editable graphics material of scientific publications. 
                            We hope that you will find the Geoterm application useful in your work or research, 
                            and we look forward to hearing your feedback.
